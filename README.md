# Hey, I'm David 👋

I'm a software engineer who loves building AI-powered tools. I enjoy turning complex ideas into products that feel simple and actually ship.

## What I'm Building

### [Umbrella Mode](https://umbrellamode.com) ☂️
**AI-powered motion graphics** — Design motion by typing, not keyframing. Describe what you want, and it creates beautiful animations in seconds. No After Effects. No curves. No keyframes.

### [wcp](https://wcp.dev) 🔗
**Bidirectional log streaming for AI agents** — Run dev servers in the background so your AI can debug errors while you watch logs live. Works with Claude, Cursor, and OpenCode. Zero-config setup.

### [Vibe Reader](https://vibereader.app) 📖
**Speed reading trainer** — Train your brain to read faster with RSVP technology. One word at a time, perfectly timed, precisely highlighted.

### [Referencer](https://referencer.ai) 🧠
**Context-aware AI assistant** — An AI that can see what you're working on and help with any questions you have. Built on top of Umbrella Mode.
